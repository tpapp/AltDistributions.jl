However, it is usually not necessary to construct Ω, so this distribution is formulated for the Cholesky decomposition L*L', and takes L directly.\n\nNote that the methods does not check if L yields a valid correlation matrix.\n\nValid values are η  0. When η  1, the distribution is unimodal at Ω=I, while 0  η  1 has a trough. η = 2 is recommended as a vague prior.\n\nWhen η = 1, the density is uniform in Ω, but not in L, because of the Jacobian correction of the transformation.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"}]
