This is a collection of some probability distributions I find useful, primarily for Bayesian estimation. Eventually, they should be considered for contributing to [Distributions.jl](https://github.com/JuliaStats/Distributions.jl), but currently they reside in this package because

1. I am experimenting with the interface,
2. I am experimenting with the implementation (making it friendly to automatic differentiation),
3. not all functionality is implemented (eg only the `logpdf`).

When the name of distributions coincides with one in `Distributions`, it is prefixed with `Alt`, eg `AltMvNormal`.
